# quizGame

Hate writing out lengthy flashcards? Don't want to pay for online quizzing platforms? You have come to right place!

With my quiz game, you can create/update/delete flashcards, flip through, AND play mini games. You can play match the card, True/False, or quiz yourself with multiple choice questions.

I honestly created this project because I enjoyed the online quizzing website but did not have the financial means to invest in the premium version. I decided that I was going to develop my own take on a flashcard learning application. I didn't think it would take too long... Right? Just make an arraylist of definitions and a corresponding arraylist of definitions. Wait! Let me use a hashmap, that might be a better data structure. No, the syntax is too confusing for the games I want to make. 

Inevitably I ended up making an Object Oriented quiz game that has Game and Flashcard classes and an interactive Main class. 

After lots of trail and error, I am happy to say I developed a successful game that I can use in school, and you can too!

You can install the project by downloading my three Java files and running the Main file in your command line interface.
