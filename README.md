# quizGame

With my quiz game, you can create flashcards that you can learn, flip through, and play mini games with (multiple choice, true/false, matching)

You can install the project by downloading my three Java files and running the Main file.

I honestly created this project because I enjoyed the quizlet website but did not have the financial means to invest in the premium version. I decided that I was going to develop my own take on a flashcard learning application. I didn't think it would take too long... Right? Just make an arraylist of definitions and a corresponding arraylist of definitions. Wait! Let me use a hashmap, that might be a better data structure. No, the syntax is too confusing for the games I want to make. Inevitably I ended up making an object oriented quiz game that has Game and Flashcard classes and an interactive Main class. 

After lots of trail and error, I am happy to say I developed a successful game that I can use in school, and you can too!
